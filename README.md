ðŸ”º Solving Easy and Hard versions of SUDOKU

ðŸ“… Due: Oct 11 11:59PM

- Used CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), by updating each empty slot and re-calculating all possible answers for the remaining slots.
- Could have used intensive backtracking, but the required threshold (easy 200, hard 250) was easily achievable just by checking the all possible answers every time a new slot is referred to.
- Left is easy (66), right is hard (118) version
